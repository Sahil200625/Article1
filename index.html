<BIG><p>"Do you have any clue how many people missed their flights? Have any care for other's problems? This looks more like a railway station and not an airport!," the passenger said in a post on X.
Another passenger complained that web check-in was not happening for around eight hours.
IndiGo is country's largest airline, flying almost 3 lakh passengers daily in both domestic and international sectors.
This July, a worldwide Microsoft outage had led to airport systems in India also going down for 17 hours. While about 300 flights had to be canceled (mostly IndiGo) then, the ones that operated did so with delays due to processes going manual.
